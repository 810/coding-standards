			<title>PHP Code Tags</title>

			<para>Always use the full &lt;?php ?&gt; to delimit PHP code, not the
				&lt;? ?&gt; shorthand. This is the most portable way to include PHP
				code
				on differing operating systems and setups.
			</para>

			<para>For files that contain only PHP code, the closing tag (?&gt;)
				should not be included. It is not required by PHP. Leaving this out
				prevents trailing white space from being accidentally injected into
				the
				output that can introduce errors in the Joomla session (see the PHP
				manual on instruction separation at
				http://php.net/basic-syntax.instruction-separation).
			</para>

			<title>Including Code</title>

			<para>Anywhere you are unconditionally including a file, use
				require_once. Anywhere you are conditionally including a file (for
				example, factory methods), use include_once. Either of these will
				ensure
				that files are included only once. They share the same file list, so you
				don't need to worry about mixing them. A file included with
				require_once
				will not be included again by include_once.
			</para>

			<note>
				<para>include_once and require_once are PHP language statements, not
					functions. The correct formatting is:
				</para>

				<para>require_once JPATH_COMPONENT.’/helpers/helper.php’;</para>
			</note>

			<para>You should not enclose the filename in parentheses. </para>
